Sayn Castle

The ruins of Sayn Castle (), the 12th century family castle of the <a href="counts%20of%20Sayn">counts of Sayn</a> and <a href="Sayn-Wittgenstein">Sayn-Wittgenstein</a>, are in <a href="Sayn">Sayn</a>, part of the borough of <a href="Bendorf">Bendorf</a> on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, between <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a> and <a href="Neuwied">Neuwied</a> in the county of <a href="Mayen-Koblenz">Mayen-Koblenz</a> in the German state of <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>. 

The <a href="ruins">ruins</a> of the <a href="spur%20castle">spur castle</a> lie on the Kehrberg, a <a href="hill%20ridge">hill ridge</a> about 110 metres long and 40 metres wide, in the foothills of the <a href="Westerwald">Westerwald</a>, between the valleys of the <a href="Brexbach">Brexbach</a> and <a href="Saynbach">Saynbach</a>. Below the ruins, the village of Sayn stretches away to the south. At the foot of the castle hill is <a href="Schloss%20Sayn">Schloss Sayn</a>, a <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> building dating to 1757.

Between the "<a href="schloss">schloss</a>" and Sayn Castle there are two former <a href="Burgmann">castellan</a> residences: the 15th century "Mittlere Burghaus", which is joined to the castle by a wall, and the 14th century "Von Steinschen Sitz" ("Stein Castle") of the lords of Stein from <a href="Nassau%20%28Lahn%29">Nassau</a>. Further east along the ridge there is the predecessor of Sayn Castle, the "Alte Burg" (“Old Castle”) from the 10th or 11th century, of which only a few remnants have survived.

Sayn Castle may be reached on the B 413 federal highway and "<a href="Landesstra%C3%9Fe">Landesstraße</a>" L 306 which branches off in Sayn. At the castle is a large car park and another one just in front of the castle wall.

Whilst the southern, western and northern flanks of Sayn drop steeply into the valley, the flat hill ridge on the eastern side, from where the castle is accessed, is protected by a deep and wide artificial <a href="neck%20ditch">neck ditch</a>. In order to provide additional protection a mighty <a href="shield%20wall">shield wall</a> with a <a href="wall%20walk">wall walk</a> was built above the moat. In the northeastern area of the site stands a well preserved, roughly 20-metre-high "<a href="bergfried">bergfried</a>", which dominates the appearance of Sayn Castle. The construction period of the "bergfried", whose walls are 2.4 metres thick in the middle, dates to the late 12th century. A wall running south from the "bergfried", also guarded by an <a href="chemin%20de%20ronde">allure</a>, divides the <a href="inner%20bailey">inner bailey</a> into two courtyards. 

Excavations in recent times have revealed that the "<a href="palas">palas</a>" originally stood on the south side of the smaller eastern courtyard, but was later moved to the western spur of the site. Today nothing is left apart from a 25-metre-deep <a href="castle%20well">castle well</a> and an octagonal <a href="staircase%20tower">staircase tower</a>. These excations also uncovered the <a href="foundation%20wall">foundation walls</a> of a <a href="castle%20chapel">castle chapel</a> at the southwestern corner in the form of a <a href="simultaneum">simultaneum</a> with three <a href="apse">apses</a> and its well preserved, ornately decorated floor dating to about 1200.

In front of the southern <a href="enceinte">enceinte</a> is a 90-metre-long and 20-metre-wide "<a href="zwinger%20%28castle%29">zwinger</a>", guarded to the east by a small <a href="defensive%20tower">defensive tower</a> and to the west by a <a href="barbican">barbican</a>. Here there is also a smaller gateway "zwinger" and, further down the hillside, the "Mittlere Burghaus" ("Middle Castle House"), which is joined to the inner ward by a wall. The excavations, carried out by the State Conservation Department, also exposed the original access track to the inner ward along the southern flank through the gate "zwinger", which may now be used again.

Edna Michell

Edna Michell is an Israeli-American violinist, pedagogue, and founder and director of music festivals, institutes, and concert series, known for her versatility and her efforts to expand the violin and chamber music repertoire.

Michell was born in Tel Aviv, and began violin studies at the age of four with Moshe Hopenko, a pupil of <a href="Leopold%20Auer">Leopold Auer</a>. She continued her studies at the <a href="Jerusalem%20Academy%20of%20Music%20and%20Dance">Rubin Academy</a> in Tel Aviv with Alice and Lorand Fenyves and <a href="%C3%96d%C3%B6n%20P%C3%A1rtos">Ödön Pártos</a>, who were students of <a href="Jen%C5%91%20Hubay">Jenő Hubay</a>. At a very young age she was awarded the <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin%20School">Yehudi Menuhin special scholarship</a> to continue her studies in London with Menuhin and <a href="Max%20Rostal">Max Rostal</a> (a disciple of <a href="Carl%20Flesch">Carl Flesch</a>). In London, she was reportedly the youngest graduate ever of the <a href="Guildhall%20School%20of%20Music%20and%20Drama">Guildhall School of Music</a>, and won the Academy Prize for Chamber Music. Michell later studied with <a href="Ivan%20Galamian">Ivan Galamian</a> in the United States, and worked with <a href="Zino%20Francescatti">Zino Francescatti</a> and <a href="Henryk%20Szeryng">Henryk Szeryng</a>. Michell’s integration of the Auer, Hubay, Flesch and Galamian schools of violin methods became a decisive influence in her life of performance and teaching.

In her teens, Michell began touring internationally, performing in recitals and with orchestras in Great Britain, Europe and Central and South America. Following Michell’s London debut at <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a>, Menuhin presented her with a Vincenzo Ruggeri violin. <a href="Claudio%20Arrau">Claudio Arrau</a>, upon hearing her, wrote that "She is a splendid musician and has the approach of a serious dedicated artist. Hers is a natural gift for the instrument..." Arrau’s efforts enabled Michell to make her New York debut at <a href="Town%20Hall%20%28New%20York%29">Town Hall</a>. Michell has performed as a duo with harpsichordist <a href="Fernando%20Valenti">Fernando Valenti</a> and with classical guitarist <a href="Rey%20de%20la%20Torre">Rey de la Torré</a><a href="Rey%20de%20la%20Torre">.</a>

Michell was artistic director of the Adirondack–Champlain Festival. The festival began as a weekend of concerts and expanded into a summer-long lineup of events and programs throughout the region. Festival performers included <a href="Michael%20Rabin%20%28violinist%29">Michael Rabin</a>, <a href="Julius%20Katchen">Julius Katchen</a>, <a href="Gary%20Graffman">Gary Graffman</a>, <a href="Claude%20Frank">Claude Frank</a>, <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20Starker">János Starker</a>, <a href="Aldo%20Parisot">Aldo Parisot</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Moravec">Ivan Moravec</a>, and <a href="Fernando%20Valenti">Valenti</a>. String quartets that performed included the <a href="Amadeus%20Quartet">Amadeus</a>, <a href="Guarneri%20Quartet">Guarneri</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20Quartet">Hungarian</a>, and <a href="Emerson%20String%20Quartet">Emerson</a>, and other groups that performed included the Cantilena Chamber Players/Cantilena Piano Quartet, and the <a href="Beaux%20Arts%20Trio">Beaux Arts Trio</a>. Other performing artists included the dancers <a href="Melissa%20Hayden%20%28dancer%29">Melissa Hayden</a>, <a href="Patricia%20McBride">Patricia McBride</a>, Jacques D’ Amboise and <a href="Edward%20Villella">Edward Villella</a>, and folk singers <a href="Odetta">Odetta</a> and <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>.

The Festival included an Institute of Advanced Musical Studies with Michell, Starker, Parisot, <a href="Roman%20Totenberg">Roman Totenberg</a>, <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Seb%C5%91k">György Sebők</a> and <a href="Walter%20Trampler">Walter Trampler</a>, and Symposia on Music Criticism and New Music led by <a href="Virgil%20Thompson">Virgil Thompson</a>, <a href="George%20Crumb">George Crumb</a>, <a href="Lukas%20Foss">Lukas Foss</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20Frankenstein">Alfred Frankenstein</a>, among others. Of the symposia, Frankenstein wrote in <a href="Musical%20America">Musical America</a> that “both programs bore the same rubric: the contemporary musical experience. They may not have defined all the contemporary musical experience, but what they did define was so beautiful and so magnificently brought of that one wished for nothing else. Modern music was superlatively well served." In <a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>, Hubert Saal described the festival as “informal but highly sophisticated.”

Michell was the founder and guiding spirit of the <a href="Cantilena%20Chamber%20Players">Cantilena Chamber Players/Cantilena Piano Quartet</a>, an ensemble known for performing well-known masterworks, premiering new compositions, and reviving forgotten or lesser-known masterworks from the 19th century re-discovered by Michell. She inspired over twenty composers to write new compositions for the ensemble. The Cantilena Chamber Players/ Cantilena Piano Quartet has performed around the world, including the Helena Rubinstein Concerts, a series founded by <a href="Michell">Michell</a>. Cantilena, with Menuhin, was invited to perform a special concert at the <a href="Lake%20Placid%20Winter%20Olympics%201980">Lake Placid Winter Olympics</a>.

Michell has received outstanding reviews throughout her career. "<a href="Music%20and%20Musicians">Music and Musicians</a> "described her as “a violinist of rare gifts,” and the "<a href="Montreal%20Star">Montreal Star</a> "wrote that "her thrilling tone has a vibrancy which sends chills down one's back and she is in possession of a technique which is quite stunning in its virtuosity." "<a href="The%20Strad">The Strad</a> "wrote that "Michell, in particular, has the same ability to soar rasphodically above the bar lines that made Menuhin's own violin playing so eloquent and memorable." Of a performance in Mexico, "Novadades "wrote that "[She] captivated the audience. Edna Michell's violin sings, translating deep sorrow and great happiness."
Michell maintained a collaborative relationship with her mentor Menuhin, which included a wide variety of musical projects, performances in concert halls, television programs, and recordings. Their recordings included <a href="Orpheus%20and%20Euridice">Orpheus and Euridice</a> by Foss, dedicated to Michell and <a href="Menuhin">Menuhin</a>, and La Muse et le Poete by <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, and Concertino for Piano Trio and String Orchestra by <a href="Bohuslav%20Martin%C5%AF">Bohuslav Martinů</a>.

Michell’s recent activities include <a href="Compassion%20Through%20Music">Compassion Through Music</a>, an ongoing project she created with Menuhin. Leading composers from around the world have written new works inspired by the theme of universal <a href="compassion">compassion</a>. The project reflects Michell and Menuhin’s belief that compassion is critical to the fate of humanity and that through music, listeners may be moved to connect more deeply with others.

Twenty-five composers have contributed pieces to the project, including Foss, <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a>, <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>, <a href="John%20Tavener">John Tavener</a>, <a href="Chen%20Yi%20%28composer%29">Chen Yi</a>, <a href="Somei%20Satoh">Somei Satoh</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Rihm">Wolfgang Rihm</a>, <a href="Hans%20Werner%20Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a>, <a href="Boris%20Tishchenko">Boris Tishchenko</a>, <a href="Poul%20Ruders">Poul Ruders</a>, <a href="Kaija%20Saariaho">Kaija Saariaho</a>, <a href="Petr%20Eben">Petr Eben</a>, <a href="Josef%20Tal">Josef Tal</a>, <a href="Iannis%20Xenakis">Iannis Xenakis</a>, <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Kurt%C3%A1g">György Kurtág</a>, Yinam Leef, <a href="Shulamit%20Ran">Shulamit Ran</a> and <a href="Karel%20Husa">Karel Husa</a>.

A CD of the first fifteen pieces composed for the project, entitled "Compassion," was released by <a href="EMI">EMI</a>. It was praised by critics, with <a href="Edward%20Greenfield">Edward Greenfield</a> writing in <a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a> that “It is due to the energy and application of the violinist Edna Michell that this impressive collection of pieces was written by leading composers...With excellent playing from Michell and all the contributors, it is a memorable, very well-recorded disc.” A second CD is forthcoming.

Monarch butterfly conservation in California

The U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a> has instituted numerous <a href="Wildlife%20conservation">conservation</a> programs, policies, <a href="law">laws</a>, <a href="Nature%20reserve">reserves</a> and <a href="Habitat">Habitat</a> <a href="Habitat%20restoration">restoration</a> projects throughout the state to facilitate the health and migration of the western population of the <a href="monarch%20butterfly">monarch butterfly</a> ("Danaus plexippus"). The population of western monarchs require very different breeding and overwintering habitat when compared to the eastern population of monarch butterflies. They require specific micro-climatic conditions to survive the winter and they are sensitive to habitat changes at the overwintering sites. The large aggregations of butterflies are seen as the most vulnerable at their overwintering locations along the coast. Many monarch overwintering sites are contained within the "coastal zone"; an area defined by the <a href="Coastal%20Zone%20Management%20Act">Coastal Zone Management Act</a> to be 1000 yards inland from the <a href="high%20tide">high tide</a> mark. Large number of overwintering sites are outside the coastal zone. There are more than 450 overwintering sites in California documented since the 1980s.

They suggest that roosting sites be identified and designed to prevent degradation of the area. They also suggest that an <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> be filed when construction is done near overwintering roasts. Removal of trees within the <a href="perimeter">perimeter</a> of the habitat should be prohibited. Tree maintenance should be performed by experts in the field. They propose that it should be unlawful to remove trees, under-story plants and vegetation near roosting sites. <a href="Reforestation">Reforestation</a> efforts should be instituted. <a href="Erosion">Erosion</a> control needs to be taken into account to maintain suitable habitat. Conservationists suggest that wood-burning fireplaces and structures should not be built near roosting sites.

One conservation group, the International Environmental Law project issued a <a href="policy">policy</a> statement regarding <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> management at Monarch overwintering sites. This group recognizes the wide variety of tree <a href="species">species</a> that monarchs utilize in their overwintering roosts. The Xerxes society recommends that eucalyptus trees remain unmolested, if monarchs roost on the trees. 

The International Environmental Law Project of 2012 has proposed model legislation and recommends the following:





Participants in Monarch Watch's waystation program have planted acres of native <a href="milkweed">milkweed</a>'s to encourage <a href="larva">larval</a> growth for monarchs. These way stations also provide nectaring plants for adult monarchs.

Most locales do not have laws or policies concerning the removal or alteration of trees within a designated monarch overwintering site. Capitola and Goleta are exceptions. Alteration of trees requires a permit in the cities. Studies continue to determine the efficacy of the continued use of eucalyptus trees as roosting trees. Large gaps in the tree canopies at the overwintering sites in California affect the suitability of the roosts.

Monarchs are protected from the effects of <a href="land%20development">land development</a>, <a href="tourism">tourism</a> in the 270 <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation">California state parks</a>. The activities of <a href="visitor">visitors</a> to the parks are regulated to include the <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a> of molesting, <a href="hunting">hunting</a>, disturbing, harming, feeding, touching, teasing, injuring, <a href="Animal%20trapping">trapping</a>, taking, netting, <a href="poisoning">poisoning</a> any animal or trees. The <a href="Butterfly%20collecting">collecting</a>, capturing and killing of any animals and the destruction of native <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a> is prohibited in the parks. Overwintering sites occur near <a href="beach">beaches</a>, <a href="universities">universities</a> and other state lands. State parks do not have specific policies regarding the maintenance of trees on which the monarchs overwinter. California historical sites are exempt from having to create monarch conservation plans.

Twenty of state parks contain monarch overwintering <a href="grove%20%28nature%29">groves</a>.


The habitat of the western population of monarch butterflies is protected from visitors and commercial activities on <a href="federal%20land">federal land</a>. Plant collection, animal collection, and the disruption of habitat are not permitted. Federal lands do not possess policies or guidelines regarding the maintenance of trees on which the monarchs overwinter. 

Overwintering monarch roosts have been observed at the <a href="Los%20Padres%20National%20Forest">Los Padres National Forest</a>, Sycamore Canyon, Pruitt Creek, the Marin Headlands, Stinson Beach, Tennessee Valley, <a href="Muir%20Beach">Muir Beach</a>, Fort Barry, Fort Baker, and the <a href="Point%20Reyes%20National%20Seashore">Point Reyes National Seashore</a>. 

Lands are managed by the <a href="Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>, <a href="Vandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> and <a href="Camp%20Pendleton">Camp Pendleton</a> are known to host Monarch overwintering sites. Monarch butterfly habitat protection does not supersede the land use needs of the <a href="military">military</a>.

The California Department of Fish and Game does not have the authority to regulate the collection and habitat changes that affect the monarch. Local ordinances sometimes provide guidelines for monarch conservation and any developmental activity. Local ordinances encourage the removal of non-native species. This is in conflict with the preservation of monarch overwintering sites because monarchs often overwinter in stands of non-native eucalyptus trees. There are some local ordinances that regulate tree removal and cutting.

Overwintering monarchs, thousands to tens of thousands have historically roosted at <a href="Ardenwood%20Historic%20Farm">Ardenwood Historic Farm</a> in <a href="Fremont%2C%20California">Fremont</a>. These roosts are protected by County regulations.

The East Bay Regional Park District raises awareness with its monarch educational programs to raise awareness of the wintering butterflies. The East Bay regional Park District has a master plan that "pledges to"identify, evaluate, conserve, enhance, and restore rare, threatened, endangered, or locally important species of plants and animals and their habitats".

<a href="Los%20Angeles%20County">Los Angeles County</a> contains at least 44 monarch overwintering roosts. These roosts exist mainly within public parks. The City of <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a>, City of <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>, and <a href="Redondo%20Beach%2C%20California">Redondo Beach</a> hosts small sites of overwintering roosts.

<a href="Mendocino%20County">Mendocino County</a> hosts the northernmost roosting sites of the overwintering monarchs in the southern part of the county, but they are only present for several weeks during the winter. It is considered a transient site. 

<a href="Monterey%20County">Monterey County</a> contains roosts of thousands of butterflies. This includes one of the most famous overwintering sites of Pacific Grove. The city of Pacific Grove has many regulations that are designed to protect the overwintering monarchs. Pacific Grove also benefits from the tourism associated with the overwintering sites there.

<a href="Pacific%20Grove%2C%20California">Pacific Grove</a> contains two large overwintering sites. These sites are populated on a consistent basis. The city has passed ordinances specifically designed to protect the monarchs and the trees on which they produced. Tree removal and maintenance is highly regulated.

<a href="Huntington%20Beach">Huntington Beach</a> contains four monarch overwintering roasts which are located in city-owned parks. The roosts are small but city regulations mandate their protection. 

There is only one roosting site in the <a href="Chula%20Vista%2C%20California">Chula Vista</a> containing about 50 individual butterflies. This site is protected by city ordinances.

Overwintering roosts of monarchs have been observed in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> since the 1920s. No regulations are place to protect the monarchs further habitat destruction.

<a href="Santa%20Barbara%20County">Santa Barbara County</a> contains 132 overwintering roosts. These can be found on state or federal land, and public and private property.

Roosts in the city of <a href="Carpinteria">Carpinteria</a> are near Carpinteria Creek, Recon Creek, the Carpinteria business Park, and the Carpinteria oil and gas plant buffer zone. "Also known as Chevron Park". These roosts contain tens of thousands to thousands of monarchs on a consistent basis. Carpinteria restricts the removal of trees and requires that development be restricted near the trees.

The city of <a href="Goleta%2C%20California">Goleta</a> butterfly counts in recent years have identified tens of thousands of monarchs roosting there. A fire in the past destroyed one of the sites. The overwintering sites in the city of Goleta are protected by relatively rigorous regulations.

The <a href="Germanium">GERmanium</a> Detector Array (GERDA) experiment is searching for <a href="neutrinoless%20double%20beta%20decay">neutrinoless double beta decay</a>(0vββ) in Ge-76 at the underground <a href="Laboratori%20Nazionali%20del%20Gran%20Sasso">Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso</a> (LNGS). <a href="Neutrinoless%20beta%20decay">Neutrinoless beta decay</a> is expected to be a very rare process if it occurs. The collaboration predicts less than one event each year per kilogram of material, appearing as a narrow spike around the 0vββ Q-value(Q = 2039 keV) in the observed energy spectrum. This means b<a href="Radiation%20protection">ackground shielding</a> is required to detect any rare decays. The LNGS facility has 1400 meters of rock <a href="overburden">overburden</a>, equivalent to 3000 meters of water shielding, reducing <a href="Cosmic%20ray">cosmic radiation</a> <a href="Background%20radiation">background</a>.

The experiment uses high purity enriched <a href="Germanium">Ge</a> crystal <a href="diodes">diodes</a> (HPGe) as a beta decay source and <a href="particle%20detector">particle detector</a>. The detectors from the HdM and Igex experiments were reprocessed and used in phase 1. The detector array is suspended in a liquid <a href="argon">argon</a> <a href="cryostat">cryostat</a> lined with copper and surrounded by an ultra-pure water tank. <a href="Photomultiplier">PMTs</a> in the water tank and plastic <a href="scintillators">scintillators</a> above detect and exclude background <a href="muons">muons</a>. Pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) is applied as a cut to discriminate between particle types.

Phase 2 will increase the active mass to 38 kg using 30 new broad energy germanium (BEGe) detectors. A magnitude reduction in background is planned to 10 counts/(keV·kg·yr) using cleaner materials. This will increase the half-life sensitivity to 10 years once 100 kg·yr of data is taken and enable evaluation of possible ton-scale expansion.

Phase I collected data November 2011 to May 2013, with 21.6 kg·yr exposure, obtaining a 0vββ 90% CL half-life limit of:

formula_1. This limit can be combined with previous results, increasing it to 3·10 yr, disfavoring the Heidelberg-Moscow detection claim. A bound on the effective neutrino mass was also reported: m < 400 meV.

The double beta decay half-life was also measured: T = 1.84·10 yr.

Phase II will have additional enriched Ge detectors and reduced background, raising the sensitivity about one order.

Phase II (7 strings, 35.8 kg of enriched detectors) was deployed in Dec 2015.

Mid 2016 : First results from phase II released. confirming reduced background and (with only 10.8 kg·yr exposure) raising the lower bound on half life.

<doc id="44228044" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44228044" title="The Tailor of Panama">
The Tailor of Panama

The Tailor of Panama is a 1996 novel by <a href="John%20le%20Carr%C3%A9">John le Carré</a>. <a href="The%20Tailor%20of%20Panama%20%28film%29">A 2001 film</a> was released based on the novel.

Harry Pendel is a British expatriate living in Panama City and running his own successful bespoke tailoring business "Pendel and Braithwaite". His wife and children are unaware that almost every detail of his life is fabricated, including his former partner, Mr Braithwaite. In reality, Harry Pendel is an ex-convict who learnt tailoring in prison.

Andy Osnard is a young British MI6 agent sent to Panama to recruit agents to gather intelligence and protect British trade interests through the canal. However, Andy has his own agenda and, after he discovers Harry's past, sees the perfect opportunity to recruit a new agent and extort money from the British government. 
Concocting a fictitious network of revolutionaries, known as the "silent opposition", Harry, through Andy, manages to gain the intrigue of the British secret services and U.K and even U.S. governments. However, Harry has used his own friends as the basis for his fantasies and as the plots are taken more seriously they become known to the Panamanian authorities and Harry struggles to cope with the guilt of setting them up. 
Harry's wife, Louisa, becomes suspicious of the amount of time he spends with Andy and suspects that Harry is having an affair. She breaks into his office and discovers all his fantastic lies. 
Harry's friend, "Mickie", kills himself rather than face the risk of going back to jail and Harry helps dispose of the body, making it look like he was executed. As Mickie is the supposed leader of the "silent opposition", the U.K. and U.S. governments use this as an excuse to topple the current Panamanian government.
At the end of the book the U.S. military has begun another invasion of Panama, based largely on Harry's fabrications and Harry watches the destruction from the window of his house.

To research the novel le Carre visited Panama on five occasions. The book was in part inspired by <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>'s "<a href="Our%20Man%20in%20Havana">Our Man in Havana</a>". Le Carré likens the tale to a ""<a href="Casablanca%20%28film%29">Casablanca</a>" without heroes", stating that he, "was drawn by the obvious corruption of Panama and the wonderful collection of characters you meet there."

In response to observations that the novel was a more light-hearted affair than his previous books, Le Carré replied that, "I think I'm in the same mood as ever, but in some ways more mature. I guess you could say that, at sixty-five, when you've seen the world shape up as I have, there are only two things you can do: laugh or kill yourself. I think my character does both. In some ways it's a very personal book. I was exploring the relationship between myself and my own fabricator. Anybody in the creative business, as you might call it, has some sense of guilt about fooling around with fact, that you're committing larceny, that all of life is material for your fabulations. That was certainly Harry Pendel's position. So I found some kind of buzz running between me and the main character, which I had not really felt since "A Perfect Spy"."

Upon publication, "The Tailor of Panama" received generally glowing reviews.

The "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" stated that, "What he has done is to venture fiercely into satire, producing a tour de force in which almost every convention of the classic spy novel is violated."

A long-running <a href="literary%20feud">literary feud</a> between Le Carre and <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a> began in 1997 after Le Carre penned a letter to the "Guardian", complaining that politically correct forces in the U.S. had labelled him anti-Semitic for his portrayal of one of the novel's characters. Rushdie responded that he wished Le Carre had expressed similar feelings after Rushdie was subject to a <a href="fatwa">fatwa</a> for "<a href="The%20Satanic%20Verses">The Satanic Verses</a>", viewed as anti-Islamic by some Muslims.

Rushdie opined that Le Carre was an "illiterate, pompous ass," while Le Carre replied that Rushdie was a "self-canonizing, arrogant colonialist."
"Guardian" columnist <a href="Mark%20Lawson">Mark Lawson</a> claimed the two authors appeared to be 'settling old scores', stating that: "The Collected Guardian Correspondence of Salman Rushdie and John Le Carre is in the great tradition of literary poison pen letters: both in their inventive viciousness and in the low personal revenges which may lie behind the high rhetoric."

Rushdie and Le Carre appeared to end their dispute in late 2012.

Matt Starr (artist)

Matthew Starr (born 1989) is a <a href="New%20Media%20Artist">New Media Artist</a> living and working in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

Matt Starr was born in Maplewood, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> to Jerold Starr and Pamela Keen, where he attended <a href="Columbia%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Columbia High School</a>. After graduating from high school Matt spent a year in Israel to serve in the <a href="Israeli%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli Defense Forces</a>. After leaving the army, Starr traveled throughout the Middle East and Europe, visiting places such as Ethiopia, Morocco, Budapest, Poland, Prague, England, France, and others. During this time Starr was introduced to documentary film-making. This introduction had a profound effect on Starr and eventually became his first creative outlet.

Starr entered <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a> in the Fall of 2008 with a self-designed major titled "Documentary Films That Can Change the World" with a minor in <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>. Starr became disenchanted with documentary film and decided to explore a form of expression that could reach and affect more diverse audiences. At this time Starr enrolled in history classes that introduced him to <a href="La%20Nouvelle%20Vague">La Nouvelle Vague</a> and the Downtown Avant Garde which Starr says completely changed the course of his life. These movements resonated with Starr’s outlook on art and his belief that art could be anything and exist anywhere. From these roots, Starr’s theoretical art practice grew.

Starr’s art is designed around the idea of a complete and total experience, rather than screen-based art. His art is multidisciplinary and multifaceted and includes an array of New Media technologies, including 3D-Projection Mapping. Starr often explores themes dealing with <a href="Taste%20%28sociology%29">low brow</a> culture and our society’s collective tendency to obsess over and indulge in these guilty pleasures. He is attracted to and captivated by patterns and social behavior, such as a piece constructed in early 2014 combining the skeleton of an iPhone and a projector to create an IRL 'in real life' selfie generator.

Many of Starr's projects and ideas explore <a href="social%20media">social media</a> culture and often designs his projects around a perceived online presence, rather than focusing on audience reaction in the gallery setting. Starr is also noted for often having his parents attend his art events. A crucial component of Starr’s work involves working with existing architecture in order to re-contextualize, transform, and recreate spaces. One such project, Matt and Taylor’s Super Fun Magic Show, 2012 involved mapping projections onto a popular set of gates in Bloomington, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>.

Since moving to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in the summer of 2013 Starr has worked with commercial clients as well as artists such as <a href="Kenneth%20Willardt">Kenneth Willardt</a>, and The W Hotels. At the end of 2013 Starr founded the “ : ) ” gang, an art collective based in NYC that produces events in line with Starr's interest in 'total experiences' noted above.

In 2014 Starr was invited to participate in the DKNY sponsored art show, "New Art City" curated by Carlos Santollala and John Tuite. For the show Starr designed an immersive installation of his lifestyle brand "diet". Matt Starr's back room installation that featured mini trampolines, a treadmill, and various items that all bore the word "DIET" in stark, white lettering. A gorgeous view of blue skies and white clouds were also projected onto the walls so that guests had ample time to get in there #NWTS selfies in while burning calories on that treadmill. David Graver of Cool Hunting said, "An entire room showcases the work of artist Matt Starr, where he has given life to a thematically ambitious wonderland of downtown cleanliness. There, a yoga goddess dangles over a grassy knoll and a full juice bar touts a clean lifestyle (though that bar will be serving rum during the event). Starr was asked to center his installation on the downtown scene, and its role almost as an urban oasis." 

In 2015, Starr created the viral trend "Babycore", which stresses childishness and a bright carefree sense of style and attitude. “I want people to embrace the essence of childhood and experience the total security that comes with not knowing — and not caring — what other people think,” Starr explains to <a href="Buzzfeed">Buzzfeed</a>. Babycore has been featured in most major publications, such as <a href="Mashable">Mashable</a>, <a href="Refinery29">Refinery29</a>, and <a href="Nick%20Jr.">Nick Jr.</a>, and was also an inspiration behind the <a href="Jeremy%20Scott">Jeremy Scott</a> and Hood by Air fashion shows.

In 2016, Starr organized a <a href="Bernie%20Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>-themed <a href="art%20exhibition">art exhibition</a> "Weekend with Bernie" in <a href="Wayfarers%20Gallery">Wayfarers Gallery</a> in <a href="Bushwick%2C%20Brooklyn">Bushwick</a>, <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. The exhibition included <a href="installation%20art">installation art</a> "Faces of Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash" by <a href="Ryder%20Ripps">Ryder Ripps</a> featuring <a href="Skype">Skype</a> video chats with members of the <a href="Facebook%20features%23Networks%20and%20groups">Facebook group</a> <a href="Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Dank%20Meme%20Stash">Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash</a> as well as a painting of Sanders as rapper <a href="Lil%20B">Lil B</a> by <a href="Ryan%20Hemsworth">Ryan Hemsworth</a>.

François Bontemps, later baron d'Abaumont, a noted brigadier general during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. He was born 1 June 1753 at <a href="Saumur">Saumur</a>, and died 29 October 1811 at Saumur (<a href="Maine-et-Loire">Maine-et-Loire</a>).

François Bontemps was born into a family of craftsmen, workers of copper and bronze, in <a href="Saumur">Saumur</a>. As a boy, his parents hoped he would become a <a href="priest">priest</a> and he was sent to study at the <a href="College%20of%20Saumur">College of Saumur</a>, and later <a href="Seminary%20of%20Angers">Seminary of Angers</a>. Lacking a <a href="vocation">vocation</a>, however, Bontemps enlisted in an infantry regiment of the <a href="French%20Royal%20Army%20%281652%E2%80%931830%29">Royal Army</a>. In 1784, having reached the rank of company clerk, and remained there for two years, he realized that he could not advance. He accepted a discharge the 4 May and returned to study the priesthood.

In 1789, François Bontemps embraced the principles of the French Revolution, and in 1792 enlisted as a chaplain in the volunteer battalion of the <a href="Eure">Eure</a>. According to battalion lore, one of the officers of the battalion insulted the priesthood. Bontemps replied that he, as a priest, forgave him, but that as a citizen, he challenged him to a duel. He later killed the man in a duel and within a few months was elected as battalion lieutenant.

His intrepidity and leadership inspired his men to grant him the nickname of <a href="Pierre%20Terrail%2C%20seigneur%20de%20Bayard">Bayard</a>, after the famous medieval French knight. This same intrepidity, and his tendency to lead from the front, caused a serious wound from a musket ball on 3 May 1800 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a>, by Engen. Despite this, he continued to fight and two days later participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messkirch">Battle of Messkirch</a>. Over the summer, though, his injury worsened and he was discharged from the army in 1801.

After his release from active service, Bontemps retired to Saumur, where he died on 29 October 1811. He is buried in the cemetery of <a href="Varrains">Varrains</a>.

After going on tour for three years with <a href="Jimmy%20Cliff">Jimmy Cliff</a> as a back-up singer, Tessanne decided to launch her solo career. she began writing songs for her the album after she left her band Mile High.

The first single "<a href="Hideaway%20%28Tessanne%20Chin%20song%29">Hideaway</a>" received heavy rotation on <a href="Jamaica">Jamaican</a> radio and select stations in <a href="New%20York">New York</a>. According to Neilsen Soundscan, it has sold over 15,749 downloads in its first week of release. The song was also featured on <a href="VP%20Records">VP Records</a>' Reggae Gold 2007. After "Hideaway," she has released two more singles, "Black Books," and "Messenger" both which were made available digitally.

Chin stated the album was made at late stages because she's a perfectionist in a kind of crazy way and it was an independent album,she also. "Contrary to popular belief, artistes don't always have a bag a money to drop on an album." Tessanne stated songs that stuck out to her were "Who"" because of its dub-style reggae feel, Flying High because it represents where she is in her life right now, "Taken" and "You and Me", the duet with her sister <a href="Tami%20Chynn">Tami Chynn</a>.

"<a href="Hideaway%20%28Tessanne%20Chin%20song%29">Hideaway</a>" has been described as a soulful reggae ballad is all about love. Which she is trying to convey her feelings to a guy she’s fallen for. She’s offering her heart as a secret hideaway from all his troubles, and to receive all the love he’s only dreamed of. Absolutely beautiful words. The Lead single "Black Books" has been described as an empowering song many women can relate to, about a man who doesn’t appreciate your worth until the relationship is over. Tessanne sings about being alone and mistreated by the man she loves, while he runs around playing games. While Messenger is a song that makes you think about what’s going on in society today. Tessanne is known not only for her poetical love songs, but also for conscious and thought-provoking lyrics

Tessanne expressed that the decision to release the album exclusively digital, is to capitalize on her music reaching fans all around the world.Tessanne also describes her debut album as an infusion of rock, reggae and soul.

Kai of EmbraceYou Magazine wrote There are two songs that I had hoped would’ve made it to the album: “Running” and “No Matter How“. It’s unfortunate they didn’t make the final cut, but regardless the album is still fanastic. Tessanne Chin did an exceptional job for her first album. The lyrics are deep and the songs are soulful; whether they’re slow reggae ballads or fast paced rock jams, she delivers without a pinch of error. A flawless record demanding a place within your music collection.

Ahmad Tafari of The Reggae Vibe wrote Tessanne Chin has finally come forward after a two-year wait from her first release "Hide Away" which was a smash hit featured on <a href="VP%20Records">VP Records</a> Reggae Gold compilation. The album "In Between Words" is one of the most Rock n Roll inspired Reggae albums I've heard. The digital album starts off with "Black Books" which has a heavy Rock feel backed by the strong voice of Tessanna singing with lots of soul! The track "The Fall" is one of the hard hitting Rock sounding Reggae tracks that has the potential to cross over into one of the Billboard Rock charts. To classify this album as just Reggae alone wouldn't correct. This album is Reggae, Rock and Soul all put together beautifully in between words. I'd like to see how many charts this album places on. Tessanne Chin was well worth the wait music like this can't be rushed be created.

All songs written by Tessanne Chin.

Qakare Ini

Qakare Ini (also Intef) was an <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> or <a href="Nubia">Nubian</a> ruler who most likely reigned at the end of the <a href="11th%20Dynasty">11th</a> and beginning of the <a href="12th%20Dynasty">12th Dynasty</a> over Lower Nubia. Although he is the best attested Nubian ruler of this time period, nothing is known of his activities.

Qakare Ini is the best attested of a series of coeval Nubian rulers including <a href="Segerseni">Segerseni</a> and <a href="Iyibkhentre">Iyibkhentre</a>. Indeed, his full <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary">pharaonic royal titulary</a> is known thanks to 16 rock inscriptions found in Umbarakab, Mudenejar, Guthnis, Taifa, <a href="Abu%20Simbel">Abu Simbel</a> and <a href="Toshka">Toshka</a>, all in <a href="Lower%20Nubia">Lower Nubia</a>. These inscriptions record Qakare Ini's titulary, sometimes only a cartouche, and never give any more details. In the case of the inscription from Toshka, Qakare Ini's name is inscribed next to that of Iyibkhentre. However, the <a href="Egyptology">Egyptologist</a> Darrell Baker proposed that this was due to the lack of space on the rock rather than pointing to a connection between the two rulers. Thus, the relationships between Qakare Ini and the other two Nubian rulers of the period, <a href="Segerseni">Segerseni</a> and <a href="Iyibkhentre">Iyibkhentre</a>, remain unknown.

Qakare Ini is not attested on any Egyptian king list.

Qakare's personal name is "Ini" although in literature he is sometimes reported as "Intef" or "Initef"; curiously, the epithet "son of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>" is placed inside the <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a>, thus rendering his name "Sa-Ra-Ini".

Qakare Ini could have been a <a href="pretender">pretender</a> to the Egyptian throne headquartered in <a href="Lower%20Nubia">Lower Nubia</a>, during the politically troubled period spanning the reign of <a href="Mentuhotep%20IV">Mentuhotep IV</a> of the 11th Dynasty and the early reign of <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> of the 12th Dynasty.

Liz Goodwin

Dr Liz Goodwin OBE (born 6 June 1961), is a British businesswoman and environmentalist, and was the CEO of the waste reduction charity, WRAP (Waste & Resources Action Programme) from 2007-2016. In 2015, she was recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list and received an OBE for her services to business resource efficiency and the environment.

Elizabeth Jane Goodwin, who prefers to be known as Liz, was born in June, 1961, in London.

Goodwin attended Chichester High School for Girls from 1972 – 1979. After leaving Chichester High School for Girls, she went on to study a BSc in Chemistry at UCL, and following that, completed a PhD in Chemical Physics from the University of Exeter. In 2010, Cranfield University honoured Goodwin with an honorary Doctor of Science, in recognition of her achievements in environmental, recycling and resource efficiency issues. The Society for the Environment also elected Goodwin as an Honorary Fellow of the Society for the Environment in December, 2013, in recognition to her services to the environment.

Goodwin started her earlier career as a Research Scientist for ICI, before working as an environment manager for Zeneca Agrochemicals, and then Syngenta as an Environmental Advisor.

Goodwin became CEO at WRAP in 2007 and has worked for the organisation since its early days, joining in 2001 as the first Director of Materials Programme. Since taking over as CEO, she has worked to raise the profile of WRAP and the issues of resource efficiency, waste and recycling. The organisation is now focused on helping deliver the economic benefits of a more circular economy.

Under Goodwin’s leadership, the Courtauld Commitment, involving major retailers, brands and their supply chains, has been driven forward and reductions in packaging have been achieved despite growth in sales. The problem of food waste is now widely understood and progress is being made in tackling this serious issue, with a 21% reduction in avoidable food waste being reported in late 2013. WRAP continues to work with local authorities and the wider resource management sector to ensure that waste that is recycled where possible.

Along with industry initiatives, two new consumer campaigns, Love Food Hate Waste, and Love Your Clothes, have been launched under Goodwin’s leadership, joining WRAP’s other consumer campaign, Recycle Now, which aims to increase household recycling.

Goodwin seeks to ensure that there is a business case for WRAP’s work, which will help ensure longer term viability and sustainability, and ways to deliver economic benefits.

In February 2016 Goodwin announced that she would be stepping down as CEO of WRAP at the end June 2016. 

Goodwin is married, and currently lives in Oxfordshire.

It is currently the oldest operating bus operator in the Illawarra.

From December 1927 until 1931 a coach service was operated to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. In January 1928 it commenced operating route 1 services from Wollongong to <a href="Austinmer%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Austinmer</a>, along with five other operators. In August 1929, Barney Dion commenced operating a service from Wollongong to <a href="Kiama%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kiama</a>.

In the late 1940s, the Balgownie and Bellambi routes were sold. By 1964, through a number of acquisitions, the Austinmer service was operated jointly by Dion's and Jim Hill. In December 1976, Dion's became the sole operator of the service and in the same year, selling the Kiama service to John J Hill at the same time. On 24 February 1992, route 4 Wollongong to <a href="Bulli%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bulli</a> was purchased from John J Hill.

Since 2008, Dion's services have been part of <a href="Sydney%20Outer%20Metropolitan%20Bus%20System%20Contracts">Sydney Outer Metropolitan Bus Region 9</a>. 

They operate 5 routes in the northern and central suburbs of <a href="Wollongong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wollongong</a>: 

A number of community and government stakeholders funded Dion's "Wollongong Summer Bus", a late <a href="night%20bus%20service">night bus service</a> run in central Wollongong during the summer months. The Summer Bus was a drink-drive and drink-walk prevention strategy supported by licensed venues as well as local government, health, police and transport authorities. It no longer operates since route 1 now operates for extended hours on Friday and Saturday nights.

As at May 2014, the fleet comprised 18 buses. The fleet livery was blue and white until 1989 when a metallic grey, blue and black livery was introduced. In 2010, the <a href="Transport%20for%20New%20South%20Wales">Transport for New South Wales</a> white and blue livery was adopted.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Dion's built their own bodies on second-hand <a href="Leyland%20Comet">Leyland Comet</a> truck chassis. In 1989, Dion's purchased two <a href="Hino%20Motors">Hinos</a>, these were the first new buses in over 40 years.

Franklinton Elementary School (North Carolina)

Franklinton Elementary School is a <a href="state%20school">public school</a> for <a href="primary%20education">primary education</a> located in <a href="Franklinton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Franklinton, North Carolina</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The multi-building complex was originally known as B.F. Person-Albion High School, which had educated African-American students, before schools were fully integrated in 1969. This school currently serves pre-kindergarten through 5th grade for students residing in the Franklinton area.

The campus of Franklinton Elementary School currently consists of eight buildings, with the most recent one constructed around 2000. A description of each building and primary functions are shown below. These are subject to change.


The first building where Franklinton Elementary School currently stands was constructed in 1929 under the direction of <a href="Max%20C.%20King">Dr. Max C. King</a> between South Hillsborough and South Main streets. It replaced the Franklinton Graded School for Negroes located down the street which had taught elementary school students. Nearby was <a href="Albion%20Academy">Albion Academy</a>, formerly a co-educational State Normal & Industrial School (trade school) for African-Americans founded by clergyman <a href="Moses%20Hopkins">Moses A. Hopkins</a> in 1879 which later became a graded school. This new building also educated elementary school students while high school students attended Albion Academy under a signed agreement by Superintendent G.B. Harris and Principal <a href="John%20A.%20Savage">Dr. John A. Savage</a>. The new graded school was named B.F. Person School in 1934, honoring Professor <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Person">Benjamin Franklin Person</a> who was first ever principal at the previous public school.

Between 1953 and 1956, more buildings were constructed at the current site which included a cafeteria, additional classrooms as well as a high school. On January 7, 1957, students and teachers from Albion Academy were transferred to the new high school. The school board renamed the facility B.F. Person-Albion High School in 1961 to recognize the consolidation of both schools. A <a href="gymnatorium">gymnatorium</a> (also spelled gymtorium), combination of gymnasium and auditorium, was built in 1960 and named in honor of Dr. Max C. King. Another building was constructed in 1967 which includes the current cafeteria and additional classrooms.

When schools were fully integrated in 1969, the upper grades were moved to Franklinton Public School which had previously educated white students. That building was renamed <a href="Franklinton%20High%20School%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Franklinton High School</a>, now called <a href="Franklinton%20Middle%20School%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Franklinton Middle School</a> as of 2013. The lower grades from Franklinton Public School were moved to B.F. Person-Albion High School, which officially became known as Franklinton Elementary School on August 5, 1969.

Aljoscha Pause

Aljoscha Pause is a German filmmaker, director, TV journalist, writer and producer.

Aljoscha Pause grew up in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a>. After completing high school he studied Romance philology at <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University</a> in Bonn. He received training as a narrator at <a href="Deutsche%20Welle">Deutsche Welle</a> between 1998 and 2002. Pause, his wife and two daughters live in Bonn.
During his school and college years, a worked at the cabaret theater "Pantheon" of his father Rainer Pause, while also working as a reporter for a local city magazine and a private radio broadcaster (Radio Bonn/Rhein-Sieg).
At the age of 24 he began a career in television, initially from 1996 to 1999 as a sports reporter at German Sports Television (now called <a href="Sport1%20%28Germany%29">Sport1</a>) and later from 1999 to 2003 at the main sports desk of <a href="Kirch%20Group">Kirch Media Group</a>, <a href="Sat.1">Sat.1</a> (with the flagship program "Ran") and Premiere, where he worked as a <a href="filmmaker">filmmaker</a>, <a href="presenter">presenter</a>, <a href="Sports%20commentator">commentator</a> and <a href="field%20reporter">field reporter</a>. From 2009 to 2011 Aljoscha Pause also served as a reporter for the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> broadcaster of <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a>, "LIGA total!"

Pause has worked as a self-employed producer and filmmaker since 2003, focusing on longer documentary films. His film projects often deal with socio-political aspects of sports (e.g. homophobia in football, hooligans, alcohol consumption and football, the German Football League for the Blind). An additional topic of emphasis is personal portraits, mostly about football players but also about actor Michael Jäger (an ex-hooligan who for ten years played a role on the early-evening soap opera <a href="Marienhof%20%28TV%20series%29">"Marienhof"</a> ). His first full-length cinematic releases were two well-received, long-term documentaries, <a href="Tom%20meets%20Zizou">"Tom meets Zizou" (2011)</a> and <a href="Trainer%21">"Trainer!" (2013)</a>. Pause has received numerous prizes and awards for his work, including the leading television award in Germany, the <a href="Grimme-Preis">Grimme Prize</a> (2010, for "Breaking the taboo").

Produced in 2008 for DSF, "The Great Taboo – Homosexuality and Football" was an "honest, dispassionate stock-taking" of the conditions facing homosexual soccer athletes in Germany. lt was the first extensive TV documentary to deal with the topic, and for this reason was honored by the Association of Lesbian and Gay Journalists (Bund Lesbischer und Schwuler Journalistlnnen, BLSJ) with the 2008 "Felix Rexhausen Prize". (Statement by the panel of judges: "Outstandingly researched and with a broad scope, this is an immensely enlightening report [...] lt shows the entire spectrum – from the fans in the stadiums to lesbian ex-professionals such as Tanja Walther and Anouschka Bernhard and the transsexual referee Marie Karsten. Spectacular is the misguided statement by <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">Cologne</a> coach <a href="Christoph%20Daum">Christoph Daum</a>, which made national headlines. The 45-minute documentary is as informative as it is sober, and subtly reveals how widespread anti-gay feeling is in the world of football – on every level."

ln the second part of the trilogy "Breaking the Taboo – The New Progress of Homosexuality in Football" (2009), Pause devotes another 12 months to the topic and films ongoing developments. According to the <a href="S%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a> newspaper, "Pause has bequeathed a journalistic exclamation mark to the private broadcasting company <a href="Sport1%20%28Germany%29">DSF</a>. He lives up to the expectations that the big publicly funded broadcasters have as yet failed to fulfill in even the most perfunctory way." One year after his first documentary, he investigates whether there were indeed any actual developments in the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> and league following the "initial spark" and discussion in 2008. For this film, Pause received the 2010 "Alternative Media Prize" and the <a href="Grimme-Preis">Grimme Prize</a> in the category "lnformation & Culture/Special".
Following the productions of "The Great Taboo – Homosexuality and Football" (2008) and "Breaking the Taboo – The New Progress of Homosexuality in Football" (2009), Pause returned in March 2011 with the third part of his trilogy on the subject of "Homosexuality in Football" with a documentary for Sport 1 called "Football ls Everything - Even Gay" in which he asks just how difficult it really is to make long-term attitude changes about a taboo topic. The filmmaker monitored developments over 18 months to prepare this documentary.

All three films were created in cooperation with the "German Academy for Football Culture".

Aljoscha Pause spent eight years working on this long-term documentary about former professional Bundesliga athlete <a href="Thomas%20Broich">Thomas Broich</a>. The film traces Broich's career in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, which began auspiciously but ended following numerous athletic and personal setbacks and disappointments with a transfer to Australian club <a href="Brisbane%20Roar">Brisbane Roar</a> in 2010.

The result of some 40 meetings and interviews over eight years, the 135-minute cinema documentary entitled "<a href="Tom%20meets%20Zizou">Tom meets Zizou – Not a Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" debuted as the opening film of the 8th International Football Film Festival "11mm" in Berlin on 25 March 2011. The state-run rating authority <a href="German%20Film%20and%20Media%20Evaluation">German Film and Media Evaluation</a> (Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung, formerly FiImbewertungssteIIe Wiesbaden rated the fiIm as "especially worthwhile". lt was distributed nationwide by "mindjazz pictures" with an opening date of 28 July 2011. The project enjoyed the support of the "DFB Cultural Foundation".

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in late 2011 and was screened at international festivals including the "International Young Audience Film Festival" in Posen, the "Thinking Football Film Festival" in Bilbao, The "ClNEfoot Festival" in Rio de Janeiro and the "Flutlicht Film Festival" in Basel (on 1 February 2014 in a double feature with "<a href="TRAINER%21">TRAINER!</a>" on the topic of "Failure"). "Tom meets Zizou" has been translated into English, Polish, Spanish and Portuguese. German broadcaster <a href="Westdeutscher%20Rundfunk">WDR</a> showed a 90-minute TV version on 21 August 2012, and the film was awarded the 2012 "VDS Television Prize". ln addition, it was nominated by the "11mm Football Film Festival" for the award "Best Football Film of All Time".

The short film "Mesut, 17" was premiered at the "11mm Film Festival" in Berlin in March, 2013. The nine-and-a-half-minute film about <a href="Mesut%20%C3%96zil">Mesut Özil</a>, who was 17 at the time, was made from footage (some of it never before used) recorded for a broadcast report about a youth soccer tournament that Pause produced in early 2006. ln addition to Özil himself, who gave his first-ever TV interview, the film also features a statement by <a href="Joachim%20L%C3%B6w">Joachim Löw</a>, who at the time was assistant to <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a>.

Originally intended solely for use at the 10th anniversary of the "11mm Football Film Festival", the film made such a good impression on Mesut Özil that he posted it to his <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page which now boasts more than 20 million fans. Due to the subsequent widespread reporting in the media and the more than one million hits it received on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> alone, the film became an Internet phenomenon that was reported on in the main evening news on <a href="RTL%20Television">RTL</a>.

Released in early June 2013, "<a href="Trainer%21">Trainer!</a>" is Pause's second full-length documentary film, for which the filmmaker observed three young professional coaches (<a href="Frank%20Schmidt%20%28footballer%29">Frank Schmidt</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Schubert">André Schubert</a>, <a href="Stephan%20Schmidt%20%28footballer%29">Stephan Schmidt</a>) over the course of a football season.

The film also takes a look behind the scenes at the football teachers' training program of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) led by <a href="Frank%20Wormuth">Frank Wormuth</a>. Established coaches like <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>, Hans Meyer, <a href="Armin%20Veh">Armin Veh</a>, <a href="Mirko%20Slomka">Mirko Slomka</a>, <a href="Peter%20Neururer">Peter Neururer</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Schaaf">Thomas Schaaf</a> and <a href="Michael%20Oenning">Michael Oenning</a> also provide extensive insights.

Altogether, Pause spent six months researching and one year filming and editing. The film is a Pausefilm production commissioned by <a href="Westdeutscher%20Rundfunk">WDR</a> (editor WDR: Steffen Simon). The television premiere of the 90-minute cut was broadcast on WDR on 3 June 2013, and the theater premiere of the 138-minute "director's cut" premiered on 11 June at the "Babylon cinema" in <a href="Mitte">Berlin-Mitte</a>. The film then toured Germany with the support of the "DFB Cultural Foundation" and distributor "mindjazz pictures", garnering enthusiastic praise from the press.

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 28, 2013. ln early 2014 Pause received the "VDS Television Prize", having already-been nominated for the 2014 "Adolf Grimme Prize". "Trainer!" will be featured at the 2014 "Flutlicht Film Festival" in Basel and at the "Joga Bonito! Festival" in Vienna.

Longline bycatch in Hawaii

The Hawaii <a href="longline%20fishing">longline fishery</a> is managed under <a href="Western%20Pacific%20Regional%20Fishery%20Management%20Council">Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council</a>’s (WPRFMC's)<a href="http%3A//www.wpcouncil.org/fishery-plans-policies-reports/pelagics_fe/">Pelagics Fisheries Ecosystem Plan</a> (<a href="http%3A//www.wpcouncil.org/fishery-plans-policies-reports/former-fishery-management-plans/pelagics-fishery-management-plan/">formerly Pelagics Fisheries Management Plan</a>). Through this plan, the WPRFMC has introduced logbooks, <a href="fishery%20observer">observers</a>, <a href="vessel%20monitoring%20system">vessel monitoring systems</a>, fishing gear modifications and spatial management for the Hawaii longline fishery. Until relatively recently, the main driver for management of the Hawaii longline fishery has been <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a> and not fishery resources.

The revival of the Hawaii longline fleet in the late 1980s meant that larger ocean-going longline vessels began operating from Honolulu. The advent of the new fleet was driven primarily by targeting <a href="swordfish">swordfish</a>, which meant using <a href="squid">squid</a> bait on hooks deployed in relatively shallow depths (<30 m) and with light sticks attached to the branch lines. Observers began to be employed on vessels in 1994 and it soon became apparent that in the shallow set fishery there were catches of sea turtles and seabirds. The principal seabirds caught were <a href="black-footed%20albatross">black-footed</a> and <a href="Laysan%20albatross">Laysan albatross</a>, and for the turtles, <a href="loggerhead%20sea%20turtle">loggerheads</a> and <a href="leatherbacks">leatherbacks</a>. There were turtle and seabird interactions in the deep set fishery also, but these were one to two orders of magnitude lower than in the shallow set fishery.

Prior to 2001, 1380 black footed albatross and 1163 Laysan albatrosses were caught annually by the Hawaii longline fishery. The WPRFMC's response to the volume of seabirds being caught was to mount a project through 1998 and 1999 to test various seabird mitigation methods. It was found that during gear setting operations, blue dyed baits were the most successful mitigation method, followed by strategic offal discards. Tori lines and a towed buoy system also proved to be effective mitigation measures during the set. During hauling operations, blue dyed baited and tori lines were found to be equally effective mitigation strategies, followed by the towed buoy. Retaining offal on the vessel during the haul increased seabird interactions.

The <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NMFS PIFSC) also tested tori lines, blue dyed bait and weighted hooks in 1999, They found that baits dyed blue and baits with additional weight reduced the number of interactions with both black-footed and Laysan albatross. Tori lines reduced contact between baits and albatrosses by 70%

The WPRFMC’s plan for implementing seabird mitigation measures was for an Fishery Management Plan(FMP) amendment where fishermen could choose the measures from a selected list of proven mitigation methods. However, this was forestalled by a 2000 US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion (BiOp) on the endangered Short-tailed albatross in, which prescribed what seabird mitigation measures would be used by the tuna-targeting (deep sets) and by swordfish (shallow sets) as follows:

The WPRFMC incorporated these measures into a Pelagics FMP amendment in 2002, requiring that these seabird mitigation measures be used when fishing north of 23 deg N. This measure was further refined in 2006 by an FMP amendment that allowed operators of Hawaii-based longline vessels fishing north of 23 degrees north latitude, as well as those targeting swordfish south of 23 degrees north, to utilize side-setting to reduce seabird interactions in lieu of the seabird mitigation already measures required.

The implementation of the seabird measures caused a massive drop in seabird interactions by more than 90% in the Hawaii longline fishery.

Despite low observer coverage, usually 5% or less, it was estimated that prior to 2001, a total of 666 turtles were caught annually in the Hawaii longline fishery: 418 <a href="loggerhead%20turtle">loggerheads</a>, 146 <a href="olive%20ridley%20turtle">olive ridleys</a>, 112 <a href="leatherback%20turtle">leatherbacks</a> and 40 <a href="green%20turtle">green turtles</a>.

Unlike the seabird issue, the solutions for sea turtles were propelled initially by litigation by environmental organizations which resulted in a complete closure of the shallow set longline fishery between 2001 and 2004. Over these years, the Hawaii fishery was only permitted to target tunas. An FMP amendment in 2002 incorporated reasonable and prudent alternative of the March 2001 Biological Opinion issued by NMFS. This amendment prohibited shallow set pelagic longlining north of the equator and closed waters between 0° and 15° N from April–May annually to longline fishing. It instituted sea turtle handling requirements for all vessels using hooks to target pelagic species in the region’s EEZ waters and extended the protected species workshop requirement to include the operators of vessels registered to longline general permits<ref name="Sea Turtle Interactions/swordfish"></ref>

Salvation was at hand, however, for the shallow-set longline fishery, based on hook research by NMFS Fisheries Engineering Laboratory in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This research found that large 18/0 circle hooks combined with mackerel type fish bait could sharply reduce loggerhead and leatherback interactions of longline vessels fishing on the Grand Banks for swordfish. The WPRFMC operationalized this technology in an FMP amendment which established a limited Hawaii-based shallow-set swordfish fishery using circle hooks with mackerel bait.

Fishing effort in the shallow-set swordfish fishery was limited to 50% of the 1994-1999 annual average number of sets (just over 2,100 sets) allocated between fishermen applying to participate in the fishery. A ‘hard’ limit on the number of leatherback (16) and loggerhead (17) turtle interactions that could occur in the swordfish fishery was implemented; the fishery closed for the remainder of the calendar year if either limit was reached. The amendment re-implemented earlier sea turtle handling and resuscitation requirements and included conservation projects to protect sea turtles in their nesting and coastal habitats. This rule implemented the requirement for night setting imposed by the USFWS Biological Opinion on Hawaii-based longline vessels targeting swordfish north of 23 degrees north latitude. The new measures resulted in a >90% reduction in sea turtles interactions in the Hawaii longline fishery. A later amendment to the Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) removed the set limits and increased the loggerhead and leatherback hard caps of 34 and 26 respectively.

The deployment of observers in the American Samoa longline fleet revealed that the fishery was interacting with green sea turtles. Most of the turtle hooking’s occurred on hooks close to the float, i.e. the shallower hooks on the longline catenary. The WPRFMC response was to amend the FEP and required fishermen on vessels longer than 40 ft to use float lines that are at least 30 meters long, and maintain a distance between float lines and adjacent branch lines with hooks of at least 70 meters. Fishermen on these longer vessels are required to deploy at least 15 branch lines between floats.

The new measure reduced green sea turtle interactions by about 75%, but the concentration of hooks at deeper depths meant that the American Samoa fishery had higher interaction rates with deep diving leatherback and olive ridley sea turtles.

<a href="Marine%20mammal">Marine mammals</a> have become a problem for the Hawaii longline fishery due to a limited population of island associated <a href="false%20killer%20whale">false killer whales</a> (FKWs) in the Main Hawaiian Islands(MHI) and interactions with a wider ‘pelagic’ population within the US EEZ around Hawaii. The island associated population was listed as ‘endangered’ under the Endangered Species Act in 2012. The interactions with the wider pelagic population drove the creation of the False Killer Whale Take Reduction Team (FKWTRT) in 2010, which developed a Take Reduction Plan (TRP) published towards the end of 2012 and with some provisions being implemented in early 2013.

The TRP required a number of different actions as follows:

Solving the FKW problem remains a major challenge to the Hawaii longline fishery. It is unlikely that the fishery interacts with the MHI FKW population, though some level of take is attributed to this population from observed takes of FKW. Interactions with the larger (1500 animals) pelagic population may continue to be greater than the Potential Biological Removals for this population.

Dealing with bycatch in the Hawaii longline fishery has had some unintended spin-offs including the reduction of shark catches by about 50%.

Euphemia Lamb

Euphemia Lamb (c.1889–1957), born Nina Forrest, was an artists' model and the wife of <a href="Henry%20Lamb">Henry Lamb</a>. She modelled for <a href="Augustus%20John">Augustus John</a> and <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a> and came to exemplify the sexual freedom of the <a href="bohemian">bohemian</a> lifestyle of the early twentieth century. Henry Lamb renamed her Euphemia, by which name she was generally known. <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> commented that Euphemia had more of a sex life "than the rest of us put together". She was one of the lovers of the <a href="occultist">occultist</a> <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>.

Nina's father was Arthur Forrest. Nina claimed that she was born on a steamship bound for Bombay, but there is no independent verification of this. She was raised in <a href="Greenheys%2C%20Manchester">Greenheys</a>, a poor district of Manchester known as a centre for prostitution. Her working class accent, however, was not to everyone's taste, and <a href="Viva%20King">Viva King</a>, another Bohemian, said of one of Jacob Epstein's busts of Euphemia, "I fancy I can hear, through the open mouth, her ugly voice".

Nina Forrest met Henry Lamb in 1905 in Manchester, where he was at medical school. They left for London as soon as they could. Henry enrolled in the <a href="Chelsea%20School%20of%20Art">Chelsea School of Art</a> and they attended the Friday Club run by <a href="Vanessa%20Bell">Vanessa Stephen</a>. Supposedly, Henry renamed Nina ″Euphemia″ because she reminded him of <a href="Saint%20Euphemia">Saint Euphemia</a> in the painting by <a href="Andrea%20Mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a> They married in May 1906 after she became pregnant, but she lost the baby due to a miscarriage.

Euphemia was one of the models who networked at the <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20Royal">Café Royal</a> before the First World War, occupying a grey area between professional model and prostitute. Her contemporaries included <a href="Betty%20May">Betty May</a>, <a href="Dolores%20%28artists%27%20model%29">Dolores</a>, and <a href="Lilian%20Shelley">Lilian Shelley</a>, along with many other young women. She was slim, pale, and fair-haired and apparently able to adopt any pose that might be asked of her. Her husky voice and slightly androgynous appearance meant that she could pass for a young man, which she sometimes did. <a href="Augustus%20John">Augustus John</a> commented to Henry Lamb, "she makes an irresistible boy".

In March 1907, Euphemia and Henry Lamb went to Paris to stay with Augustus John and <a href="Dorelia%20McNeill">Dorelia McNeill</a> at <a href="Montparnasse">Montparnasse</a>. Henry became John's pupil and Euphemia his model. John was fascinated by Euphemia's appearance and her sexual behaviour, and he nicknamed her "<a href="Lobelia">Lobelia</a>", a name he used quite openly with her husband. Dorelia became romantically interested in Henry, which John encouraged so that he could spend more time with Euphemia, though he denied any personal romantic interest in her.

Although John prized Euphemia as a model, he did not take her seriously otherwise, regarding her behaviour as quite eccentric and her stories fanciful. On one occasion, according to Euphemia, her penchant for dressing like a man had unfortunate consequences, she and John were arrested as homosexuals and she was required to undress in custody in order to prove she was a woman. She also claimed that she had a revolver and was prepared to shoot herself and her husband, and that she had caused the death of John's first wife <a href="Ida%20Nettleship">Ida</a> who had died in childbirth.

Battles with Henry forced Euphemia in the direction of <a href="Duncan%20Grant">Duncan Grant</a>, whose relationships were usually homosexual, but he was repulsed by the complicated love life of the group, particularly John's encouragement of Dorelia's relationship with Henry, writing to <a href="Lytton%20Strachey">Lytton Strachey</a>, "That Lamb family sickens me", and referring to Euphemia as "the white haired whore". By the summer of 1907, Euphemia had effectively left Henry, although they did not divorce until 1928 when Henry wished to marry <a href="Pansy%20Pakenham">Pansy Pakenham</a>.

John continued to follow Euphemia's liaisons with interest, reporting to Henry in August that Euphemia had "made the acquaintance of a number of nations" and the following year to Dorelia that "Lobelia had 6 men in her room last night, representing the six European powers".

The sculptor Jacob Epstein created a number of busts of Euphemia in marble and bronze, the best known of which is the bronze bust in the Tate Gallery which the gallery dates to 1908, but which Epstein dated to 1911 in "Let There Be Sculpture". Three studies of Euphemia are in the <a href="Leeds%20City%20Art%20Gallery">Leeds City Art Gallery</a>.

Around 1910, Epstein completed for <a href="Ottoline%20Morrell">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a> a garden figure of for which Euphemia was the model. A plaster model of the work was exhibited in 1911 and a bronze of the torso completed in 1912.

In Paris, Euphemia became the lover of the <a href="List%20of%20occultists">occultist</a> Aleister Crowley; in 1908 they conspired to humiliate Crowley's male lover and acolyte <a href="Victor%20Benjamin%20Neuburg">Victor Neuburg</a> by convincing him that Euphemia was in love with him while Crowley pressed him into visiting a brothel, thus making him unfaithful to her. Crowley gave Euphemia the name "Dorothy" in his "Confessions" and described her as "incomparably beautiful ... capable of stimulating the greatest extravagances of passion".

In 1910, Euphemia met <a href="James%20Dickson%20Innes">James Dickson Innes</a> (1887–1914) at a cafe on the <a href="Boulevard%20du%20Montparnasse">Boulevard du Montparnasse</a>, and the two began an affair which was more intense for Innes than for Euphemia who never restricted her relationships to just one man. According to Euphemia, they travelled through southern France together. Innes was already suffering from the <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> that eventually killed him. In 1910 or 1911, with Augustus John, he established a small artistic commune at "Nant Ddu" cottage in north Wales. Visitors included John and Dorelia, <a href="Derwent%20Lees">Derwent Lees</a>, <a href="Ian%20Strang">Ian Strang</a>, and Euphemia, who Innes painted against the background of <a href="Arenig%20Fawr">Arenig Fawr</a>. It was said that when the relationship was over, Innes buried a silver casket of love letters from Euphemia on the summit of Arenig, the mountain in some way representing the scale of Innes' unrequited love for her.
Among Euphemia's other lovers were the poet Francis Macnamara and the author <a href="Henri-Pierre%20Roch%C3%A9">Henri-Pierre Roché</a>.

Little is recorded about Euphemia's later life. In 1934, she married the painter Edward Grove, but they divorced in 1942 or 1943. Euphemia died in 1957.
